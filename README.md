# Consumer-Producer-Threads
A Consumer/Producer thread file repository

This is a Consumer/Producer thread reader to introduce multithreading and buffer classes.
These recently have more and more impact in my day-to-day programming so I have begun to compile useful code in this repository.
I am quite new to github repositories but I imagine that I'll have a lot of experience with it in the future.
